# Solar Energy Prediction Estimator ☀️

A professional web application that calculates real-time photovoltaic energy output based on current weather conditions (temperature and cloudiness) for any city in the world.

## ⚙️ How it works
- **Weather Data:** Fetches live data via OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Physics Engine:** Calculates irradiance and applies thermal derating factors.
- **Customizable:** Users can adjust panel nominal power and efficiency.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-time Data:** Fetches current temperature and cloud cover for any city.
- **Technical Analysis:** Calculates irradiance and thermal derating factors.
- **Customizable:** Adjust panel nominal power and system efficiency via the UI.
- **Modular Architecture:** Clean separation between UI (Streamlit) and Logic (Python).
